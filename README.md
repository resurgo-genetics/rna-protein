# rna-protein
we want to benchmark the developed RBP binding sites prediction tool on different datasets

We firstly collected the published datasets from CLIP-seq data, and we need collect as many as possible

Datasets
iONMF datasets: aleardy be in https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS 
Graphprot datasets: http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/GraphProt_CLIP_sequences.tar.bz2

Computational methods:
1. RNAcontext:  http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hilal/rnacontext/
2. GraphProt: http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/
3. iONMF (it integrates mutiple source of features, we only using sequence and predicted structure probability): https://github.com/mstrazar/iONMF
4. iDeep (also only sequence and predicted structure probability): https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeep
5. iDeepS (sequence and predicted structure probability): https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS
